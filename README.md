# URBN Coding Assessment

This repository contains the Urban Outfitters Coding Challenge.

Weather web application that interact with the user to give it data (location) to return the location provided, temperature, description, feels like, humidity, and wind speed. 

This application is build on using React js, with API calling using aixos from https://openweathermap.org/.


# Objective

Create a simple app that interfaces with a public open API (http://www.programmableweb.com/apis/directory). The app should utilize an interaction pattern, such as user input/button, geolocation, etc. to pass information to the API, and with returned data, create content on the page. This is really up to you to decide what you want to make here, so do something that is fun!

Structure your app as you see fit. Connect to the API via xmlhttprequest, $.ajax, angular resource, fetch, or whatever you are most comfortable with. Use any framework, and any structure to your app, but be prepared to justify your selection. We use Vue.js here with SSR for reference. We encourage you to commit often and comment thoroughly while you work so we can get a good feeling of your progress through the application.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
